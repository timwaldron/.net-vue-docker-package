# Boilerplate Fullstack Application

|Frontend|Backend|Database|
|-|-|-|
|[Vue 3 + Typescript](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)|[C# ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)|[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

All wrapped together in a neat little [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container!

## Introduction
This is a small repository I've decided to develop because every time I go to start a new project
I have to spend the first couple of days setting up and configuring the exact same things:
* A frontend framework
   * Configuring a proxy passthrough to the backend
   * Authentication / Authorisation
* A backend framework
   * Controllers/Services/Repositories
   * Authentication / Authorisation
   * Token Generation
* Database
* Slapping it all in a Docker container
* Getting the tech stack to communicate

Ideally once this is finished (still in progress) I'll be able to just fork this repository, and start working on the fun-_ner_ parts of a project.
